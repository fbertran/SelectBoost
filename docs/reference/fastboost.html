<p>A numeric matrix with attributes.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="details">
    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p><code>fastboost</code> returns a numeric matrix. For each of the variable (column)
and each of the c0 (row), the entry is proportion of times that the variable was
selected among the B resampled fits of the model. Fitting to the same group of variables is
only perfomed once (even if it occured for another value of c0), which greatly speeds up
the algorithm. In order to limit memory usage, <code>fastboost</code> uses a compact way to
save the group memberships, which is especially useful with community grouping function
and fairly big datasets.</p>
